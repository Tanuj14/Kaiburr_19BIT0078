RL-for-Sepsis
Problem Statement
sepsis occurs when chemichals released in the bloodstream to fight an infection trigger

#WHY DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNIGN FOR SEPSIS? The nature of our problem requires us to learn a policy from data.Policy formally defined is a function that maps states to action probabilities. Thus, we want to learn a policy that takes action in order to best treat the patient.

#WHAT IS REINFORCEMENT LEARNING? Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behavior in an environment to obtain maximum reward.

#HOW DOES RL WORKS? In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error
